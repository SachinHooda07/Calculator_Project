Calculator :- 

In this project, I created a scientific calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I designed and added buttons for various mathematical functions. When a user presses a button, the calculator performs the calculation using JavaScript. I used reference code to ensure accurate calculations. The calculator is highly responsive, working smoothly on different devices. This project helped me learn and apply new web development skills effectively.
